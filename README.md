# Comfort_measurement_system
these codes are part of my thesis project at *Politecnico di Milano* in partnership with *Ferri Corse 4x4* titled: "Preparation and analysis of an off-road vehicle for heavy duty, development and integration of a system for inertial measurements".

Thanks to a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and four GY-521, it was possible to find useful information about human perception related to mechanical vibration (comfort measurement).
As of now, the project is in state of: "proof of concept", but could be updated over time.

Python 3.6.x or newer version is needed.
